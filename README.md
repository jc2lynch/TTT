Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the first Project

My board will look like a chalk game of Tic-Tac-Toe that takes place on a traditional chalk board. I will focus on all
of the core objectives and then I will try to add one add on- the score counter

CORE REQUIREMENTS Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

Render a game board in the browser Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select) 
Declare a winner if a player gets three in a row, cat's game if neither does Allow for two players to compete on 
separate devices
